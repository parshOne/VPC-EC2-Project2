I have used files 
 -> Ec2.tf : In this i have code for two aws instances , one attached to private subnet and one public subnet.
 -> Providers.tf : This is just providing access key and secret key.
 -> Vpc.tf : In this file i have created vpc for the above two instance whith a partiular CIDR , security group with
     inbound and outbound rules ( ie. tcp, http ).
     Nat gateway and elastic eip is also given to public subnet Ec2 instance.
     
 -> Subnet.tf : For creating a public subnet and private subnet.
 -> routetable :  In this we have created route table attached to internet gateway , associated to bothy public and private subnet .
 
 -> Here the private subnet Ec2 instacne will connect ot Nat gateway for accessing internet so there is a security given to that.
